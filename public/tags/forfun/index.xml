      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite horror movies of all time is Stanley Kubrick&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Shining&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;. It has minimum deaths and killing but still conveys the same kind of fear and anticipation every horror movie has. So, after finding myself absolutely bored in the middle of November 2019, I gave the movie a spin again. It was the scene when Wendy finds out that Jack had abandoned his play to write the sentence &amp;ldquo;All work no play makes Jack a dull boy&amp;rdquo; in different variations that had inspired me to write up some code. Something about the variation was particularly spooky, and I wanted to copy it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
