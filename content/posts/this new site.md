IT'S been a type of thing I've been thinking about for a while- a website for all my thoughts. A place for essays on anything, "research papers", and ideas written in my own voice and writing style/format.

So, it begins- eversley.space. A new era of my life where I shall be documenting my ideas and thoughts. My project process and words, words, words and words.

ONE may ask why the painting "I Love the Whole World" by Agnes Martin is on the home page. Perhaps I'm feeling a bit "cultured" some may say... but it's just something about Agnes Martin that makes one feel a bit more.

Yes. It's just line. Another work of abstract/modern art.  

But rather than a group of patterns, it reads to me as a canvas of emotion.

The color palette is limited. The yellow conveys as a sort of innocence. It's the color of a yellow flowers growing on the side of a road. It's the color of baby chicks being born.

What about the grey? Color seems like a grey cloudy day. The grey that clouds seem to taint themselves with along with their white innocence.

I would like to end with a poem by Alfred Lord Tennyson called "Ulysses".

	Old age hath yet his honour and his toil;
	Death closes all: but something ere the end,
	Some work of noble note, may yet be done,
	Not unbecoming men that strove with Gods.
	The lights begin to twinkle from the rocks: 
	The long day wanes: the slow moon climbs: 
	the deep Moans round with many voices. 
	Come, my friends, 'T is not too late to seek a newer world. 
	Push off, and sitting well in order smite
	The sounding furrows; for my purpose holds 
	To sail beyond the sunset, and the baths 
	Of all the western stars, until I die. 
	It may be that the gulfs will wash us down: 
	It may be we shall touch the Happy Isles, 
	And see the great Achilles, whom we knew. 
	Tho' much is taken, much abides; and tho' 
	We are not now that strength which in old days 
	Moved earth and heaven, that which we are, we are; 
	One equal temper of heroic hearts, 
	Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will 
	To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield. "

Goodnight Seattle.
