  Summary
  <a class="anchor" href="#summary">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The word “Baroque” means highly decorated. People of the time who did not like the ornate and overly decorated art and architecture of the period found it “grotesque” or in bad taste.</p>
<p>Music was full of ornamentation and embellishments: overlapping voices and melodies, trills, and runs that decorated the music. It is during this period that ballets, operas, and oratorios (an epic story that is told by a large choir, orchestra, and soloists without props or costumes) began, as well as other forms like concertos, preludes, fugues, etc. Most importantly, it was the beginning of the orchestra where composers would specify which instruments play what part of the music. A Baroque orchestra typically consisted of string instruments, woodwinds, and brass. The violin, however, was the star (reflected a soprano’s voice or melody line). What’s most interesting is that composers began to use Italian expressions to describe music (and that’s still used today). For example, words such as <em>Allegro</em> and <em>Andante</em> described speed.</p>
<p>During the Baroque period, art and music were supported by a patronage system, this being people in the nobility and church class. While Baroque composers wanted their music to be more “passionate” and “expressive” it was strongly discouraged. The Doctrines of Affections was this aesthetic theory that a piece of music should have one feeling rather than multiple feelings as one could not handle it (be SWOON). Some of the major feelings composers included are sorrow, pain, devotion, and heroism. TLDR: one emotion at a time and this would also create unity within a piece.</p>
<p>Opera began in the baroque period starting with Italy and spreading throughout the rest of Europe BUT England during Oliver Cromwell’s Puritan regime (it was considered a <em>frivolous diversion</em>).</p>
<p>Some famous composers: J.S. Bach, Handel, Purcell, Scarlatti, Vivaldi, Telemann, and Pachebel.</p>
<p>(not related to music but French made wigs soar in popularity. The idea was to get your hair so ridiculous and complicated. There was some lady who wanted her hair to look like a whole ship)</p>

  Distinct Features
  <a class="anchor" href="#distinct-features">#</a>
</h2>
<p>For music nerds, here are some of the distinct features of Baroque music.</p>
<ul>
<li>Rhythm- strong, energetic, steady, very repetitive</li>
<li>Melody- less tuneful, more embellishments of trills and ornaments</li>
<li>Texture- polyphonic, many voices used against each other in counterpoint (SATB style)</li>
<li>Harmony- used a system called figured bass (a numerical shorthand under the bass line. Somewhat like jazz when you have lead sheets and you fill in the parts that go with the single line melody.</li>
<li>Tempo and Dynamic- Baroque composers started to indicate how loud/soft or fast/slow they wanted the music to be</li>
<li>Tonality- The church modes that dominated music was replaced by major and minor keys. You start to see a shift from a single chant to different voices having different parts</li>
</ul>

  Baroque Music Samples:

</h2>
<ul>
<li>Water Music Suite No. 1 in F major by Handel
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJyTfttQvdA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJyTfttQvdA</a> (BBC Proms Performance)
<ul>
<li>Water Music is a collection of dance-like pieces and fanfares written for King George I as royal entertainment for a summer party on the Thames river.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Little Fugue in g minor by J.S. Bach
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhRa3REdozw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhRa3REdozw</a> (Ton Koopman, Organ)
<ul>
<li>There are just so many voices against each other (counterpoint). There’s a short theme repeated in the first voice and a second one repeats it while the third and fourth voices answer it. Bach is legiterally a genius when it comes to fugues and composing music within counterpoint rules.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hallelujah Chorus in Messiah by Handel
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6_nJ11BgTE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6_nJ11BgTE</a> (London Symphony Orchestra)
<ul>
<li>One of the most popular oratorios is Messiah. Handel wrote the whole thing in three bloody weeks, saying“I think God has visited me” when he finished writing it. Funny story about this chorus: King George II was so stirred during the Hallelujah Chorus, he stood up during the performance and the rest of the audience followed his suit. It’s tradition to stand during this chorus.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Jesu Joy of Man’s Desiring by J.S. Bach
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doJ2Fd6JRpQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doJ2Fd6JRpQ</a> (Bishop&rsquo;s Stortford College)
<ul>
<li>This piece doesn’t exactly have much history but it is a chorale (a hymn tune of the German Protestant Church that is used in cantatas or organ compositions). You just <em>know</em> this piece.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>*NOTE: I didn’t include Bach’s most well-known piece, Toccata and Fugue in d minor because there’s a lot of conspiracy that he didn’t actually write it. So just have fun with these. If you really want to listen to it, well, you already have plenty of horror movies (but here’s a link for funz: <a href="https://youtu.be/Nnuq9PXbywA)">https://youtu.be/Nnuq9PXbywA)</a>. You can still get all the fun Baroque feeling you want.</p>

  Summary
  <a class="anchor" href="#summary-1">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Ahh yes, <em>classical music</em>. You must first understand that this only refers to a certain era of music, rather than a whole genre of music.</p>
<p>During the Classical period, composers returned back to simplicity, looking at ancient Greece and Roman as role models of sorts (relates to the whole neoclassicism stuff). Music, much like the architecture, was more plain, elegant, and uncluttered, tuneful, and free of baroque trills and frills.</p>
<p>Wealthy individuals and people with disposable incomes started to pay to attend concerts and composers had a new audience. In other words, musicians and composers alike could make a living without relying on the patronage of the nobility and the church.</p>
<p>Classical music was written with greater simplicity than the music of the Baroque period. There was usually one melody at a time with clear patterns and forms. The leaders of this new style were J.S. Bach’s sons Carl Phillip Emanuel Bach and J.C. Bach. They turned away from the elaborate contrapuntal style of music and focused on making the soprano voice the most important rather than all voices equal.</p>
<p>Whereas the music of the Baroque period was focused on one idea and emotion at a time (created unity within a piece; also, remember the Doctrine of Affections), classical music was based on contrasts. Classical composers experimented with dynamics and speed. You would find that some songs contained both softness and loudness, and were at tempos fast and slow. The pieces were often full of surprises and each movement would have its own key, tempo, and themes.</p>
<p>The newest form of music was the symphony, a long work that had three to four movements for an orchestra. Other forms of music include overtures, themes and variations, <em>more</em> operas, and concertos. The piano was also “invented” and it replaced the harpsichord’s metally sounds with a gentle tapping of wood and certain fabrics. The orchestra also expanded, now up to 40 members with more string, brass, woodwind, and percussion instruments.</p>
<p>The most famous composers of this era are Mozart, Haydn, and Beethoven (although, Beethoven was a bridge between Classical and Romantic era music). Mozart was a child prodigy and instead of being a music director in a royal court, he would have concertos and operas instead. He would be one of the firsts to write piano concertos. Haydn was known for “inventing” the string quartet, a style of chamber music that balances between the four instruments (violin I, violin II, viola, and cello). Beethoven was actually one of Haydn’s students, but many times, refused to accept the rules of composition, thus being that transition between Classical and Romantic era music.</p>
<p>Besides that, I just wanted to mention one other “fun” thing. Austria, at that time and to this day, is still considered the music capital of the world. Both Haydn and Mozart were born there and since Joseph the II was such an admirer of the arts, music flourished there.</p>
<h2 class="heading" id="classical-music-samples">
  Classical Music Samples:
  <a class="anchor" href="#classical-music-samples">#</a>
</h2>
<ul>
<li><em>Eline Klein Nachtmusik</em> by Mozart
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb_jQBgzU-I">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb_jQBgzU-I</a> (Les Dissonances - David Grimal)
<ul>
<li>The piece translates to “Little Night Music” and it was written for strings in particular. What’s interesting is that it was found after Mozart’s death so it’s considered a VERY mysterious work. You <em>know</em> this piece.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>The Heavens are Telling</em> by Haydn
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4lSauxyFWo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4lSauxyFWo</a> (Choir of New College, Oxford)
<ul>
<li>There are 3 angles that sing (a trio). It took Haydn 2 years to revise this piece since it was like his magnum opus. He was greatly inspired by Messiah- the oratorio called creation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Piano Concerto in G major</em> by Mozart
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTO77dwm6uk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTO77dwm6uk</a> (Leonard Bernstein and Musikschule Lengerich)
<ul>
<li>Less history on his piece but a couple of things I wanted to point out: it’s in concerto form, featuring orchestra and piano (the piano is somewhat of a solo). Mozart wrote the piano part for himself to play and show off with cadenzas.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>String Quartet Op. 76, No. 3</em> by Haydn
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doJ2Fd6JRpQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doJ2Fd6JRpQ</a> (Bishop&rsquo;s Stortford College)</li>
<li>Themes and variation form here, each instrument takes over in the variation. Haydn is known as the father of the string quartet (features 2 violins, viola, cello). In the premiere of this piece, the audience was given lyrics to sing the Emperor for his birthday (Francis the II of Austria).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>*NOTE: For fun, if you’re curious about one of Mozart’s most famous operas- look no further than the Queen of the Night’s aria. So bloody famous and good and HIGH NOTES THAT ARE IMPOSSIBLE TO ACHIEVE with my lungs. Here’s the link: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuBeBjqKSGQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuBeBjqKSGQ</a>. This is the Royal Opera House at it’s best :)</p>
