    <p>For Sartre, “bad faith” is a person who denies their own freedom and confines themselves yet relies on the freedom to deny themselves. It’s a form of self-deception and basically tricks your own mind to believe in something based on your own lies.</p>
<p>I think Todd and Neil both actively practice “bad faith”. They both create this image of themselves that they believe they most live-up to based on not only what their parents say, but what their teachers expect out of them, what other girls expect of them, their peers, and even society and the class of people they belong in. They’re blindly following what others believe is best for them and they believe it is good as well because of what others say. Neil had believed once that he “wanted” to be a doctor because of these factors (primarily his father), but ultimately once realizing he can make his own person and be that person, he wants to pursue acting original love for acting instead. It was something he knew he was good at but he is limited by what others expect of him. The same somewhat goes for Todd. Being a lawyer is something he “wants” to be but ultimately, he can’t be because of his anxiety with public speaking.</p>
<p>With both of these characters, from the people that they are surrounded by, they both believe in something that is the projection of others. It isn’t a projection of their own thinking or emotions, it’s something that others have projected onto them and they believe now since they are constantly reminded of it.</p>
<p>On a more personal note, I think I’m in the same situation sometimes. I have a feeling that I’m quite good with logic and sciencey stuff and I do plan on studying it in my higher education. It’s interesting stuff, don’t get me wrong. But I want to do pursue something like music, even if I’m not awesome at it. But I ultimately feel like if I have the skills to do something/research that will save lives and help the people I’ve lost due to things like cancer, why would I give that up for something that only expresses my emotions and is less valuable? Perhaps I’ve developed the idea of this through my peers, teachers, and family.</p>
<p>I think, in the end, Mr. Keating’s actions were helpful for their emotions and expressions but not so much for what their parents wanted them to be. Their parents have set this standard on their children, expecting them to pursue a certain profession or acting in a certain way. It was all about following rules, restricting your initial reactions and emotions. Limiting your expression to what is proper and following what others deem “right”. If there we to be thrown back into the society the parents and headmasters wanted them to follow, Mr. Keating’s actions were quite destructive for their perfect molds. But for their individuality and own person, Mr. Keating’s action showed them a new pathway for optimizing their uniqueness.</p>
