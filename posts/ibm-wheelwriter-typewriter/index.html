</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve said this many times, but one of the things I regret is not buying the brand new IBM Selectric II I once saw on sale for $65.</p>
<p>The Selectric series was one of the most popular electric typewriter of the 20th century. It featured a ball type element (the thing that pushes letters onto the page) that spun around to the correct key through a series of clever pulleys and levers.</p>
<p>The problem with typewriters before then is the mechanism by which letters were pressed and printed onto the page. Each key corresponded to an arm with a letter at the end that would stamp the page when pressed. This was not only slow, but oftentimes, fast typing would &ldquo;jam&rdquo; the keys all together, making it rather difficult to type. It&rsquo;s not to say that old typewriters were bad, if anything, they are exceptionally clever. I&rsquo;m just not planning to get into the details of that here.

<p>Interestingly, this is why we have the QWERTY keyboard layout. The idea is for keys that are common used to be spaced further apart to prevent this arm jam (if you want to read more about it, you can read here <a href="https://widespacer.blogspot.com/2015/11/the-hidden-secrets-of-qwerty.html)">https://widespacer.blogspot.com/2015/11/the-hidden-secrets-of-qwerty.html)</a>. Of course, other people have suggested other keyboard layouts, such as the elusive Dvorak, but apparently statistical analysis has shown that QWERTY tends to win every time in a paper by Neil Kay (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.respol.2013.03.007" title="Persistent link using digital object identifier">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.respol.2013.03.007</a>)</p>
<p>Anyway, back to the Selectric. This ball mechanism was exciting in the sense that it was the first true innovation to the typewriter since its inception. The keys also look very similar to the ones we use today, especially the keycaps. For a machine created in the 60s, this was damn impressive.

<p>If other typewriter stuff interests you, the history of them is here: <a href="https://ibmtypewriters.com/history-of-the-ibm-typewriter-categories/the-typewriter-an-informal-history.html">The typewriter: an informal history - Batchelor Business Machines</a> while a more interesting read on the Selectric itself is available on the IBM website. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/history/selectric">The IBM Selectric</a> I have to say, the best part about the IBM page is the incorporation of print ads they have. I particularly have been fascinated with the print ads of the 50s, 60s, and 80s, so it&rsquo;s fun to see the ones created for machines and technologies at the time.</p>

</h2>
<p>The IBM Wheelwriter is a way less popular line of typewriters. Also electric, the Wheelwriter came out in the mid-1980s and utilized a daisy-wheel as its type element. When a key is pressed, the wheel would spin to the correct corresponding letter and then that would be stamped to the page. These wheel cartridges could then be swapped out for different fonts.

Fig. 4&ndash; This is the typewriter I ended up buying when I saw it on sale. It is an IBM Wheelwriter 10 Series II from 1988.</p>
<p>Since it is an electronic typewriter, it stores some electronic memory. Interestingly, the manual does say that if battery replacement was needed, to plug in the typewriter and then place in the batteries to prevent memory loss pertaining to page setting.</p>
<p>The keys are different than the Selectric however, as these are buckling springs. Much more fascinating is the fact that the Wheelwriter came along as the same time as the IBM Model M keyboard. There are entire subreddits dedicated to this exact mechanical keyboard that will do a much better job at explaining why exact it was so brilliant. For context sake, the brief rundown is that the IBM Model M not only has pleasant auditory feedback, but it is also known for its durability and typing consistency. It is rather difficult to explain a tactile experiences here, so I&rsquo;ll leave it to the reader to do whatever searches they wish.</p>
<p>I will admit, Wheelwriter is just way less interesting compared to the Selectric as the cultural impact is not as large, but I have found it as an incredible second typewriter to tinker around with and fix here and there. The fondness I have this machine is similar to my curiosity towards history and old technology. In a way, it is hard for me to comprehend the brilliance that is modern computing today and understanding the machines of the past allow me to better appreciate the clever and collaborative effort of so many people. This is just one of the many things that will continuously allow me to enjoy the wonders of humanity, in a rather very very silly way.</p>
<p>Plus, it sounds nice when I type.</p>
