  Whose Pain is it, Anyway?

</h1>
<p>In this paper, I will review and discuss arguments for and against “the Claim” that “If doctors should be legally permitted to help patients die when they are in terrible, untreatable physical pain, then doctors should be legally permitted to help patients die when they are in terrible, untreatable psychic pain,&quot;<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. I will use Rachel Aviv’s “The Death Treatment”, Ramon&rsquo;s view from The Sea Inside, and Jacob Appel’s “A Suicide Right for the Mentally Ill?” for consideration towards this claim, keeping in mind well-being and autonomy. Finally, I will then move to a discussion on why I agree with “the Claim”, as well as some reasons to reject it.</p>
<p>In Rachel Aviv’s New Yorker article, she tells the story of Godelieva De Troyer, a Belgium woman who suffered from clinical depression all her life. She was in therapy since the age of nineteen and with each new doctor, she adopted a new therapeutic process and her doctor’s philosophy of life. In her 60s, she continually fell into depression and lost faith in the psychiatrist she had seen for more than ten years; he acknowledged all he could “was listen to her and prescribe antidepressants, as he had been doing for years” because there was no cure for her condition. At sixty-three, Godelieva meets Dr. Wim Distelmans, who just so happens to support the law passed in Belgium that permits euthanasia for patients with physical or mental suffering due to incurable illness. It was after this meeting that Godelieva went through the procedure of euthanasia and left behind her son, Tom, who was outraged that he was not included in the discussion and decision of his mother’s euthanasia.</p>
<p>This brings us to the discussion of two considerations of “the Claim”: 1) is untreatable psychic pain as unbearable as physical pain? and 2) who may understand a patient’s need best to provide the right treatment?</p>
<p>The first consideration is the statement that untreatable psychic pain is as unbearable as untreatable physical pain<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. Jacob Appeal has two points on how psychic pain can be as unbearable as physical pain. The first of which is that people do not need to suffer the symptoms of mental illness all the time to feel psychic pain. In another hypothetical scenario, we are told that a patient has an unbearable burning sensation in their hands every third-day . While this pain is physical, it may manifest into a mental torment on the other two physically unaffected days as this person remains anxious and agonizes over the pain they will have to endure again on the third day. Eventually, this unbearable mental torment is enough to drive a person to think there is no point in living. Secondly, Appeal mentions how conditions of this suffering may be so painful as to make it reasonable for someone to want to not live in that state. For Godelieva, in her later years, she mentions how her lack of energy has impacted her ability to drive to see her son and grandchildren. It is remaining in this state (being unable to see her grandchildren and feeling as if she failed as a mother and grandmother) and after trying to treat herself through various psychiatrists, that Godelieva feels that she has lost her levensperspectief<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>, wishes to escape this state, and then death. In the case of Ramon Sampedro, he is paralyzed from the neck down, making him terminally bed-bound. For Ramon, living meant a connection with the sea, the freedom to express physical affection, and independence from depending on others. All of this is stripped from him when he becomes paralyzed, and thus, he wishes not to remain in such a state because that is not living for him. These examples and Appeal’s points illustrate that untreatable mental pain is just as unbearable as untreatable physical pain, demonstrating to us that we can think of mental suffering as physical suffering.</p>
<p>Having established untreatable mental pain as unbearable leads us to think about who may understand a person’s need the best to treat this pain. The obvious answer seems to be the patients themselves. Dworkin describes how each man is considered to be a master of his own body, and thus, would best understand what well-being looks like for themselves. We see this with Ramon: the decades spent as a quadriplegic have left him with a clear and rational decision that death is the best way to treat his mental suffering. For him, living well means a variety of freedoms, all of which were unobtainable, and thus, he justifies death as the very best option. Thus, Ramon’s decision to die is an autonomous choice since he has the ability to reflect critically on his desires, values, and beliefs about life. However, this can be tricky, as Appeal suggests that someone can be suffering from a mental illness that may hinder their ability to make a clear-headed decision. If one’s ability to reflect on their desires has been disabled and decision-making could be compromised, then what does autonomy look like to best treat unbearable mental pain?</p>
<p>Others may argue that a doctor can understand a patient’s needs best, and thus, make the decision to treat the pain with death. After all, decision-making can be impeded by emotions, so we may need an expert opinion on the matter. Gawande and Ackerman have argued that when a patient is disabled by emotion, good doctors are “crafty” and should intervene by pushing patients toward certain options that ultimately favor the patient’s well-being. In the case of Godelieva, she is in an extremely depressive state when she sees her psychiatrist for more than ten years. When he suggests there is not much else he can do, Godelieva falls into greater despair, believing that her emotional progress has all been an illusion. It is Dr. Distelmans’ intervention and suggestion of euthanasia that allows Godelieva to make a clearer decision on what she wishes to do with the state of her life and depression. She has suffered all her life living in “black”, and Dr. Distelman respects her free will and well-being by understanding that she wishes to end living in such a state. Some may worry, like Dr. Patrick Wyffels<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>, that doctors might influence a patient’s decision to die or live with their own values. However, a doctor can still influence a patient’s decision while respecting her capacity for autonomy if they don’t prevent her capacity from exercising this capacity or treating her in a way that she can not rationally endorse. Dr. Distelman has done both of these things for Godelieva.</p>
<p>So, what does respect for autonomy look like for those who do not have competence? If a patient has become demented and pleads for the desire not to live in their condition, what does showing respect for autonomy require? One rationale is to leave this decision up to representatives of the patient, such as a family member. Since they have spent the most time with the patient, surely they must know what respect for the patient’s autonomy looks like. We can reference Dworkin’s thoughts on the demented self and what respect for autonomy looks like. Dworkin suggests two conditions must be satisfied: 1) the past and present selves are the same selves and 2) The present self must not be capable of forming “global desires” or his life as a whole making self-governing choices. Dworkin believes that life is continuous, regardless of whether one remembers it or not, and thus, our past self is the same as our present selves. In the case that an incompetent individual seeks death for unbearable mental suffering, Dworkin says showing respect for autonomy means respecting one’s past competent self that has thought of this circumstance. If their past selves have desired to not remain in such a state and ask for euthanasia, then doctors are in the right to provide them with such a wish and vice versa. However, allowing others to make that decision for him based on what they believe is most consistent with an ideal or character is disrespecting autonomy. In the case of Godelieva, if she were considered demented in her latter years, her diary presents that her past self considered suicide after her husband’s suicide. She wrote that “‘I am just like him,’”, and therefore, Tom would be in the wrong if he acted in a way to prevent her euthanasia. Aviv cites Van Loon, “May they be allowed to die like human beings? Or must they wait until they are nothing more than a corpse so that their next kin can comfort themselves with their remains?”</p>
<p>I believe that “the Claim” is reasonable: doctors should be legally permitted to help patients die when they are in terrible, untreatable psychic pain. I have established that untreatable mental pain is just as unbearable as physical pain. In addition, I discussed that in the case of treating this pain with death, who would have the patient’s well-being and desires in the best interest to go through this treatment. Doctors and patients work together in favor of a patient’s well-being and the respect of their autonomy, even if it comes to death.</p>
<p>I do recognize that there may be reasons why someone may reject “the Claim”, with one of these concerns being that of a society that offers euthanasia as an option. Velleman suggests that having options can be harmful itself: in one way, it eliminates the ability to “enjoy” the status quo by default. In this situation, option 1 is staying alive by default without having deliberated about the pros and cons of living. But once given the option (option 2) to die through assistance, option 1 is now altered into option 3: living on with this belief that one’s choice can’t be justified or is irrational in that there is a loss of self-respect and the belief that others aren’t justified in respecting them. No longer does one have option 1 of staying alive without having deliberated the pros and cons of living. I do have some criticisms for this take, in that, while option 2 may not be an option for many people, option 4 has always existed in that one commits suicide. For an individual to contemplate death, they have already reached a point of deliberating the pros and cons of living. In some cases, Aviv cites Vandenberghe who finds that some euthanasia requests end up being therapeutically useful as patients who would otherwise not seek medical help do so by consulting with doctors about their feelings. In the cases of those who are determined and set on ending untreatable mental suffering in their state, what would be the harm to offer them a dignified death?</p>
<p>This also relates to concerns of countries of Belgium that have shifted to more secularized politics, and as a consequence, secularized education. For children who grew up learning that euthanasia is an option and end up suffering unbearable mental illness, the option of euthanasia might end up being the thing that cures them or respects their autonomy.</p>
<p>Finally, in the case of doctors wronging family members of the one being euthanized, I have some final thoughts. Aviv mentions the poor quality of psychiatric care in Belgium which led to the discovery that Godelieva had never had electroconvulsive therapy. This leads me to wonder if her psychiatrists ever suggested invasive procedures as treatment for her depression. If not, they have failed her by withholding information (disrespecting her capacity for autonomy) and Tom has the right reasons to feel that his mother’s death was wrong. However, if Godelieve had previously rejected invasive procedures and preferred therapeutic means, her autonomy would have been respected and is not of Tom’s concern. After all, whose pain is it, anyway?</p>
