  Can we be certain that there is a self which exists throughout the lifetime of an individual?
  <a class="anchor" href="#can-we-be-certain-that-there-is-a-self-which-exists-throughout-the-lifetime-of-an-individual">#</a>
</h1>
<p>How are we sure that the person I am right now is the same person that I was three minutes ago? And will I be the same person three minutes from now? These collective wonders question the certainty of a self that exists through the lifetime of an individual. And to better understand how we may arrive at a conclusion, we need to define what the self is and if that self exists through a period of time (and in this case, the lifetime of an individual). Two philosophers, Rene Descartes and David Humes have their collective thoughts on the topic of what a self is and the evidence/logic that explains their thinking. Here, we’ll first explore their conclusions and how they have arrived at them. A dissection of their differences will follow by a few paragraphs and concluding on a personal conclusion of the question.</p>
<p>Descartes would argue, yes, there is a self that exists throughout the lifetime of an individual. While he would doubt any observations perceived by one’s senses, it’s the doubting part of him that is sure he exists. His basis for this is his Cogito argument, in which it is assumed that there is an evil deceiver who has created a reality for me to sense and perceive. So, I must doubt everything I observe and because I am aware that I am doubting (since doubting is a form of thinking like understanding or refusing), I know that I exist. Thus, his famous line “I think, therefore I am.” Descartes is sure that at least his thinking self exists but can not thus his body where observation is perceived through his senses. This leads to his second thinking that the mind and body are separate in that the body’s perceptions and observations can not be trusted but the mind’s doubting of that exists. In short, Descartes believes that an individual exists throughout their lifetime as long as they are thinking about their existence (the act of thinking allows them to know that their thinking self exists).</p>
<p>Humes would argue otherwise, that no, there isn’t a self that exists throughout the lifetime of an individual. Humes believed that we are constantly changing and that at no point in my lifetime are there any of me that is the same as the now-me. In other words, there exists no then-me that is the same as the now-me no matter the interval of moments. This conclusion is arrived at by Humes being skeptical of the thought that our “personal identity arises from consciousness, and consciousness is nothing but a reflected thought or perceptions” (Humes). Instead, Humes believes that our consciousness is a collection of rapid impressions or experiences. These experiences can be observations we perceive with our senses (which he believes is reliable), memories of what we’ve experienced based on our observations perceived by our senses, or reasonings and relations we’ve determined based on our senses. It is the collection of these impressions that allow us to make judgments presently. This comes to his conclusion that we are constantly changing as our collection of impressions is constantly changing. And if the present-me is made up of a collection different than the collection of three-minutes-ago-me, I can not say that I am the same self throughout my lifetime. In other words, while there exists a “present” self, that “present” self is not and will not ever be the same as any other self in my lifetime as our collections of impressions are different.</p>
<p>Both of their approaches to the topic are vastly different: Descartes relying on the metaphysical approach while Humes relies on the empirical approach. In other words, Humes has placed trust in the observations perceived by one’s senses and assumes it to be true. He then uses those observations as evidence for his claim about our collection of impressions. Descartes, on the other hand, uses logic to determine one’s self rather than depending on the observations and experiences we’ve obtained from our environment. In short, Descartes holds that although the senses report back what they “see”, they are being fed lies and can not be trusted while Humes holds that observations perceived by the senses are truths.</p>
<p>Besides their approaches towards the question, their definitions of what the self constitutes of is also vastly different. Descartes, through his Cogito argument, argues that the only self that we are certain exists is his thinking self, the part of him that is conscious that he is doubting the observations his senses perceive. Humes disagrees, so far as to say philosophers other than him seem to be inclined “to think that personal identity arises from consciousness, and consciousness is nothing but a reflected thought or perception”. Unlike other philosophers, Humes also believes that “Our thought is still more variable than our sight”. Humes holds that the present self exists and is a collection of impressions yet that self is unlike any other self that exists on that person’s timeline.</p>
<p>When it comes to consistency as a definition of self, Humes is skeptical about a consistent self that exists. He holds, instead, that the self is constantly changing. With each passing moment, the self from a moment ago is not the same as the now-self. This is because their collection of impressions is now different. The self adds experiences such as ideas, perceptions of senses, thoughts, or feelings to the collection of impressions rapidly. Descartes, on the other hand, holds that a consistent doubting-self allows for the existence of a self. As long as you are consistently doubting the perceptions you are projected or thinking about your existence, you exist.</p>
<p>And finally, the two have different views on the mind and body of a self. While Humes assumes that they intertwined together to create the collection of impressions, Descartes does not. Descartes believes that the two are separate, although work closely together. For him, this dualism proposes that the mind controls the body, yet the body can also influence the mind. The two work separately, often deceiving each other. For Humes, he trusts the observations perceived by the body and it’s the mind that collects these observations. It’s the mind that creates relationships and connections between the observations. It’s the mind that provides a present testimony on the observations perceived by our senses. The two work together like a combined machine to understand the self and the reality they live in. In short, Hume’s conclusions and definitions depend on the thought that the body and mind are intertwined and work together while Descartes’s conclusions and definitions assume that the body and mind are separate and that the observations perceived by the body must be doubted.</p>
<p>After comparing both sides, Descartes makes a better argument that there is a self that exists throughout one’s lifetime. Though his conclusions are not backed by observations that are perceived by his body (or senses), he realizes that these observations are not certain to be the truth as they could be a false projection. Descartes uses this to doubt the things he senses. He, instead, uses the logic of his doubting self to conclude that his doubting self exists and as long as he can doubt his existence, he exists. By relying on logic rather than faulty evidence, he can make a stronger argument as to the certainty of a self existing through one’s lifetime.</p>
