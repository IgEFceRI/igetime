  <div class="single-content">
    <p>I think the most shocking part of the movie was when the perspective of the movie changed from Nash’s to reality. It suddenly dawned on me that some of the most important figures in his life, Charles, Marcee, and Parcher, were all from his mind. That they don’t exactly exist. The film does a fantastic job of making us believe that those characters exist in the first half of the film.</p>
<p>Another scene I think about a lot is the office reveal scene where Sol and Bender take Alicia to see what Nash is working on. We’re still in the shock of realizing that Nash has schizophrenia and this scene tops everything off. It’s beautifully haunting, almost like a beautiful display of mind “madness” (although, madness isn’t exactly how I would describe it? There isn’t an exact word I can use to accurately describe the scene). What intrigues me so much is the fact that yes, there are papers everywhere with pen markings, tape, string but, everything is connected and has a reason behind each paper cutout, placement, and pen marking. Every piece serves a function. The whole scene was complex and so hauntingly beautiful at the same time. It’s like a physical display of his mind and how it works, even if we don’t know for sure if that’s what he was thinking of or how his mind actually works.</p>
<p>As for a philosophical question that can be raised by this movie: What defines normal and crazy/abnormal? When do those lines blur or how are they related? Who gets to decide? Generally, I think we think of normal being something a majority of people can agree with or something, like last week’s assignment, something that’s a habit for the world. Thus, if someone were to eat bananas starting in the middle, we would think that’s not normal since a majority of us eat bananas starting at one end and gnawing our way down. As someone who likes to listen to swing music and jazz, I’m considered “weird” by my friends who all tend to listen to rap or pop music (really whatever is “trendy”). But to another circle of my friends who love jazz, it’s normal to like jazz. In these two examples, it’s clear that who gets to decide: a group of teenagers who like trendy music and jazz lovers. For Nash, the people who get to decide if he is normal or not are society and science. A majority of people in society believe that imagine and seeing people who don’t exist isn’t normal. Science says that Nash has schizophrenia, but that’s because a majority of people don’t have it. Perhaps in a whole of people who also have schizophrenia, it’s completely normal and they won’t say they have schizophrenia.</p>
<p>In the office scene, when Nash’s office was revealed, Sol and Bender tell Alicia that Nash has always been kinda weird, making it seem like it’s normal for him to be weird. It’s almost like a habit for Nash, his personality. In other words, if Nash were to act “normal”, it would be abnormal for him.</p>
<p>While writing this, I thought of another question: Does a person need love in life? Do they need love to survive? What is love? What is it’s function? If someone was brought up without any love, companionship, friendship, and alone, would they be able to go through life? Technically, yes. If given the essentials, that being shelter, food, water, air, a person can physically live sure. But do they need love in life? Is it an experience?</p>
<p>We see that a good amount of people in Nash’s life do indeed love him, expressing it through friendship (Martain), the willingness to spend time with him (Alicia), to help him with his schizophrenia (Alicia and Dr. Rosen), etc. Even interactions between his imagined characters, Charles and Marcee, provide him some kind of love/friendship. Was he without these things and people, would he have been able to live? But also, are those actions expressions of love? By doing those actions, does it mean that they care for Nash?</p>
<p>Also, how powerful is imagination? And how does that blend with real-life (the cross of fiction and reality) and how do we use it? We humans have come so far because of imagination. Everything we do, we have like modern science, the arts, technology, all come from our imaginations. We&rsquo;re here today because of imagination. I would say, because of these things, imagination is quite powerful. But it can be also &ldquo;destructive&rdquo;, if that makes sense. Like how it altered Nash&rsquo;s life, almost wrapping him in another reality.</p>
