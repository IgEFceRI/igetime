<p>In this paper, I will summarize and evaluate Daniel Brudney’s worries in his paper “Are Alcoholics Less Deserving of Liver Transplants” (the worries of the moral weight of behaviors and the moral significance of luck), focusing on whether certain behaviors trigger a lesser claim to scarce resources, like that of livers. I will then shift to a discussion on distributive justice&rsquo;s role in a just policy. Finally, I will conclude with my criticisms of Brudney’s position.</p>
<p>Brudney starts his paper by introducing us to a hypothetical world, in which Jane has a diseased liver due to her long-term drinking that was sufficiently voluntary. Her condition is that if she were to receive a liver transplant, it would likely be successful. Another patient, Jack, is also in need of a liver transplant due to liver failure caused by uncontrollable factors<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. On a liver transplant list, where would these two individuals be placed? In other words, what is the moral weight of Jane’s past drinking behavior when it comes to her placement? This ambiguity could range from Jane losing any chance to a liver to her drinking behavior being a tie-breaker.</p>
<p>An unsurprising take emerges: Jane has a weaker claim to receive a liver than Jack. Since she knowingly and repeatedly chose to engage in health-risking, avoidable, and voluntary behavior, she deserves the consequence of being placed lower on the list. In other words, Jane has a weaker claim to this scarce medical resource because her need for a liver can be traced to choices that can put her health at risk. Brudney introduces this as “The Principle”, which also affirms that fairness is placing Jane lower on the list to prolong Jack’s life, rather than someone whose disease was self-imposed. However, if the fact of death is considered, this position is put into question. To lower Jane&rsquo;s place on the list is to deprive her of the opportunity for a longer life and significantly increase her mortality. This also implies that Jane’s drinking is immoral enough to warrant death. I, like Brudney, believe that most people would think it is unfair that drinking deserves a punishment that would increase Jane’s chance of death– this consequence is too excessive. The problem lies when applied, the “the Principle” is too broad and vague it favors extreme punishments, and I do not think just to impose such a heavy moral weight on Jane’s conduct that resulted in her disease. After all, we don’t have to abandon individuals who bear responsibility for their own afflictions<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. Nonetheless, if “the Principle” is disregarded and Jane’s conduct has no moral weight, Jane and Jack’s placement becomes a mere flip of the coin, and that does not seem fair to Jack. There must be some other factors in consideration to find a reasonable balance.</p>
<p>Brudney brings up the moral significance of luck. One suggestion is that we could maximize and utilize the effects of bad luck as a scale for determining someone’s position on the list. Jack should be placed before Jane because it would be unfair for Jack to die given his disease was because of bad luck (out of his control), but it would not be unfair for Jane to die because she chose to engage in voluntary health-risky conduct. Except, Brudney shows us that this line of thinking is not universal by introducing us to Jill, someone who drank just as much as Jane but contracted liver disease through no fault of her drinking. Given these conditions, Jill would not be penalized by being placed lower on the list because she did not cause her disease as Jane did– Jill’s disease is also due to bad luck. Yet, this is a bad application of luck: in the same way that Jack’s disease was due to bad luck, Jane could be equally as unlucky as Jill with a genetic predisposition for alcohol. From my perspective, it is unhelpful to assign moral significance to something as unmeasurable as bad luck as a means to find a fair solution. I think we can not deny the role that luck plays in our everyday lives; some may even say that “life is unfair” and that our mistakes sometimes result in terrible consequences. However, when that consequence is death in a roulette-like world, I think many people would like to take their chances elsewhere. A good example of this is in the case of negligence, where two mothers bathe their babies and then leave the room to answer the phone. When they return, one baby has drowned while the other remains alive, happily splashing. It is without a doubt that the mother of the drowned baby would feel horrid at her negligence, and thus I believe luck should not play any moral significance; both mothers equally participated in “bad” behavior and one should not be punished more than the other just because she was unlucky. As Brudney suggests, public institutions should not use luck and function like this, and consequently, nor should liver transplant lists. Hence, the moral significance of luck shouldn’t play a role in determining placement. </p>
<p>Amongst this discussion, we can start to see some of the principles of distributive justice surface. By taking all sorts of different considerations to determine how we should allocate a scarce resource, like livers, we figure out what may establish a stronger or weaker claim. This leads us to consider the existence of a just policy may help us figure out such an appropriate placement. Imagine a proposed policy that would penalize alcoholics by placing them lower on the list, thus, reducing the demand for livers as the policy will deter people from drinking and ruining their livers. Enacted, proper education would be put into place and it would only affect alcoholics in the future, as it would be unfair to those currently faced with alcoholics (they had no advance notice as the policy ceased to exist then). Brudney suggests that this policy would tell us something beyond what “the Principle” tells us about Jane’s voluntary conduct; it reveals a clear moral difference. He suggests two cases: 1) Jane, having liver disease, is unaware that the preservation of her life would result in Jack&rsquo;s demise, and 2) Jane is aware of the consequences of drinking (being placed lower on the list for a scarce resource), yet her liver disease is brought on by her voluntary conduct. In the first case, because Jane lacks the knowledge of the impact of her conduct and does not know she will harm people with it. It does not display negligence or ill will towards others. Therefore, since Jane has done nothing morally immoral, she does not morally deserve a severe punishment. In the second case, however, Jane demonstrates recklessness with her conduct. To know that such an action could result in the harming of others by reducing their chances at life and to still drink your liver away, Brudney argues shows “callous disregard” for those who are in need. Jane makes herself a competitor for a scarce resource, showing contempt for the rest of us, and therefore, it is fair for a public institution to judge her for that. This is what matters when formulating such a policy. Brudney proposes that a person has a weaker claim to a scarce resource if and only if 1) they knew (or had reason to know) that their behavior was likely to contribute to her need and 2) they knew (or had reason to know) that the relevant resource was scarce. If these conditions are fulfilled, then that person’s indifference to others means they deserve a penalty, and this is reasonable distributive justice.</p>
<p>I think Brudney’s position is an interesting take. For the most part, I agree with this take on punishing those who act indifferent to the needs of others. The critique I have of Brudney’s position is the unintended consequences of his proposal, one of which is the problem of stigmatization and social justice. If such a policy were enacted, would the response towards drinking be like that of the success of the anti-smoking campaigns (individuals who drink are characterized as lacking self-control) or like that of the results of the prohibition era (drinking was realized to play a large part of social life)<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>? If those who drink are seen as “callously indifferent”, I wonder if fostering this stigmatization may mean that people may lose opportunities– perhaps also in the case when drinking could make up much of the person’s social life and is a necessary component of their livelihood. Would this end up causing indifferent harm to those indifferent? In addition to the previous critique, I question Brudney’s use of “had reason to know” and the situation in case 1. In a similar case, anti-smoking campaigns were greatly pushed in the late 80s and 90s, and yet, low SES areas still face high alcohol and drug usage. In some cases, tobacco companies purposefully target those who live in low SES areas. Thus, a policy’s education and informative aspects may not always be distributed fairly. This demands us to quantify or even ask what is “enough reason to know” that one is acting indifferent due to the lack of access to quality education or maliciously. Brudney’s proposal seems to target those who are disadvantaged, but presently, it is a step up from “the Principle”’s vagueness.</p>
<p>One last critique I have is that we are living in a world where scarce resources like organs for transplants lose their status as scarcity each day as research in synthetic biology and growing artificial organs progress. Brudney suggests that if the scarcity of livers were not a problem, then helping Jane would hurt no one. I disagree with this thinking, as now the problem is that of time, similar to that of the law of mass action. While there might be an abundance of livers, there is a limited number of physicians who can transplant those livers at once, and thus, the question of who should receive transplants first or last is brought to the table. Indifference is not exactly the main concern now, instead, the time-sensitive nature of transplant treatment is. Some may even argue that this could be answered with biology. But for now, it may be easier to imagine a point in the future where “He&rsquo;s stealing my cirrhosis!” no longer is a fictional line said by actors playing sick for medical students… or still be stuck watching reruns of Seinfeld.</p>
