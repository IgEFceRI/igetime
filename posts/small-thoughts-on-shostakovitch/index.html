    <p>I&rsquo;m not exactly a huge fan of Shostakovitch, but I find his music very interesting theoretically, as well as the history behind them. His orchestral symphonies basically tell the story of his relationship with the Soviet Union and <em>cough</em> Stalin <em>coughs</em>. For example, the 5th Symphony was considered highly successful for him and the SU. He was able to manage to tread the fine line between personal expression and official approval. The 7th Symphony starts off with this march that only builds in intensity and it symbolizes the Nazi&rsquo;s invasion of Russia (it&rsquo;s titled Leningrad). The 9th Symphony (often known as the &ldquo;grand&rdquo; symphony of a composer) was supposed to be very heroic and prideful to celebrate the end of the war. Shosty, however, pulled a reverse uno card so the entire piece is careless and light. It&rsquo;s actually quite funny. The SU and Stalin didn&rsquo;t think so and took it as a personal offense, so he, among other composers like Prokofiev, was &ldquo;banned&rdquo;. The 10th Symphony was written right after Stalin&rsquo;s death, so read into that what you will.</p>
<p>One last note about Shostakovitch. His ballet the Golden Age is about a Soviet football team traveling abroad that comes into contact with Western culture for the first time. Here&rsquo;s the program note that he writes for the ballet: &ldquo;Throwing into contrast the two cultures was my main aim[&hellip;] the West European dances breathe the spirit of depraved eroticism which is characteristic of contemporary bourgeois culture[&hellip;] but I tried to imbue the Soviet dances with the wholesome elements of sport and physical culture.&rdquo; But when you listen to the results, it&rsquo;s pretty obvious that the more interesting musical developments are those representing the West. In the words of the conductor Michael Parloff &ldquo;the West gets all the best lines&rdquo; meaning that Shosty was able to creatively experiment with music representing something &ldquo;bad&rdquo; and &ldquo;weird&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s all these loopholes in the work he composes for the state that makes everything much more interesting and tells the tale of a composer repressed under the rule of the SU.</p>
