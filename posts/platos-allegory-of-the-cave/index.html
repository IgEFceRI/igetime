    <p>I think we are exactly limited by our senses, it’s just hard to think “outside” of the box because we’ve become so accustomed to it and evolved our world another these 5 senses. The actual world has been incredibly altered by this fence/fog of senses we have. I’ve always thought that people see different colors than me, as in they see the same green as me but it’s different for each person slightly in terms of tints and that sort of thing. But at the same time, we’re still behind our three color receptive cones in our eyes, the small hairs in our ears, the lack of microscopic bumps on our skin, etc. The mantis shrimp has 16 colors receptive, allowing them to see way more colors than humans. Dogs have better hearing than us, and certain reptiles have microscopic bumps on their skin so they can feel molecules of water. Their reality of the world is much different than ours but yet, their realities are also limited.</p>
<p>I think Plato is right, in order to discover the world, we must use our intellect. I can think of gravity being one of them; we can’t exactly “feel” gravity at all when we’re standing on our two feet. Isaac Newton was able to use science and mathematics to prove that there is a force that holds all things down. However, I think our intellect can only better our understanding of what is real. It can not be a concrete definition because there will always be something we can’t just figure out, but we can try our best (using our intellect, science likes to “find” these things) to reach as close to it as possible (like a limit in calculus).</p>
<p>This leads to the next question- are we not all prisoners to our sensations? And I think yes, we, as humans, are trapped by our biology, by our genetics, by our minds, by our senses. Those are the things that limit us from seeing the true reality. That makes me think of a question I’ve always had&ndash; how do I know I’m real? Sure thing, I can touch my skin, or pinch it, but is my touch valid? What counts as a touch?</p>
<p>I have synesthesia, allowing me to combine my senses in a way (eg. I can hear colors in music, or feeling emotions in colors). It causes me to think very differently as well from the conversations I’ve had with my friends, I’m often “painting” my thoughts in splotches of color onto a blank canvas. For me, a great deal of that is my reality&ndash; I experience the world in color and these weird paintings. But that is very different than the people around me, they don’t experience the music with colors flying every which way in their heads. So what really counts as listening to music? Or what is the reality of listening to music? Is it what the majority of people hear it as, is that the “ideal form”? Perhaps we have different realities because our experiences are different, but that statement is not concrete.</p>
