    <p>So, it all started as a small math project- to research any topic we wanted and relate it to calculus. Of course, as soon as I heard the words &ldquo;any topic&rdquo;, I was off, thinking all sorts of ideas that I could do: music theory (specifically why some chords sound better than others), the golden ratio, origami? At this point, I was just trying to relate any hobby of mine to calculus. We still had a couple of months left so I decided to leave the project alone for a while and focus on other things.</p>
<p>As the deadline drew closer and closer (now only a mere 2 weeks), I figured I should probably start on this project. But the words &ldquo;any topic&rdquo; just made me burnout with ideas. Frustrated, I decided to clean my room for once since the dust was building up.</p>
<p>After a while, I found this box in the corner of my room. It&rsquo;s an 8&rsquo;&rsquo; by 12&rsquo;&rsquo; by 8&rsquo;&rsquo; clear plastic box with a whole lot of maps- the ones you get at rest stations while on a long road trip. It had been a while since I last opened the box, and it was covered in a thin layer of dust.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about maps that excites me: you have a physics aspect, things involving the 3-D and 2-D world; things involving calculus, how you would stretch the lines of latitude and longitude; and of course, art! It&rsquo;s one of my favorite aspects since the way you present a map changes how the reader perceives the map. Plus, if John Green&rsquo;s TedTalk taught me anything, it was the concept of &ldquo;paper towns&rdquo;, fictional places on a map for copyright purposes.</p>
<p>It then dawned on me that I should totally do a project on cartography! There was calculus in the study so why not do it? Besides, I had wanted to know how maps were made for the longest time so I could make a &ldquo;mind map&rdquo; art project.</p>
<p>For the next two days, I spent around 10 hours looking for photos of maps and articles needed for research. And finally, on a Friday night, literally 15 minutes before the deadline, I finished!</p>
<p>So, attached is my project on mostly the Mercator Map Projection. The slides derive the latitude distance function and how it relates to the Gudermannian Function. You can find it <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1t-NRefD2yAXolmbnUUhhYR2yovb15jKF1p7v5n2yJxg/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p>
<p>A small reflection on this project: I do think I&rsquo;ve found a small little passion for cartography now. Something about how it connects math, physics, and art just makes me really happy and interested to learn more. It&rsquo;s one of my better-researched projects and I think it began my drive to do more similar projects.</p>
<p>Excited for feedback!</p>
