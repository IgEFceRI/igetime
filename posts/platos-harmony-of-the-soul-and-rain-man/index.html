    <p>I think that Plato’s theory of the soul is not capable of differentiating people who are normal from people who are abnormal. I think it’s important that we must see things from their point of view (that being the abnormal) as well. For them, what they consider to be which part of the soul is much different and we can’t just use the same molds for them/apply our perception of each part to them. In other words, you can’t decide what is just for them because their perception of reality is much different than that of ours, this includes the method of how they think. Thus, you can’t determine what their reasons are without looking from their perspective.</p>
<p>Take the scene when Raymond refuses to fly on an airplane. His spirit is pulling him back, telling him it would be dangerous to go on the plane. His reason would then endorse what his spirit says, being justified by the crashes that airlines have had before. His appetites then force him to act out so he can communicate to Charlie that he really doesn’t want to fly by plane. His reasons allow him to since Charlie previously ignored his requests. In another scene where Charlie is messing with Raymond’s books, Raymond becomes nervous and starts doing “Who’s on First”. His appetites want his books to be left alone since that is what is most comfortable for him and put him at ease. He then does so by doing “Who’s on First” to communicate how he feels. His reason endorses appetites through Raymond physically and verbally, trying to convey his discomfort of Charlie touching his books. In both these cases, his soul is considered harmonious since he is able to use reasoning to determine what he would do in the situation, endorsed by spirit or appetite.</p>
<p>To conclude on this idea, their soul can be harmonious in their world but abnormal and disharmonious to us/normal society. Which begs the question of who is right to judge if one’s soul is in harmony or not? Do we look at it through “normal” people’s view or an individual’s perspective? From what I’ve written above, I believe the latter while still using the same molds but applied differently.</p>
<p>I think what would be considered abnormal to Plato is someone who lacks one part of their soul or is unable to settle the conflicts between emotion and reason. In other words, the majority of actions are disharmonious. Rather than being guided by reason, they are constantly guided by either appetite or spirit. Someone could also lack one part of their soul by their motives being influenced only by appetites, or only by spirit, with a complete disregard for the other two. This would be viewed through the individual’s perspective. For example, someone who is constantly indulging in pleasure (sex, food, relaxing, without responsibilities).</p>
