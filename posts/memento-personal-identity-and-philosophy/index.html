    <p>After watching Memento, I believe Lenny best demonstrates Hume&rsquo;s description.</p>
<p>Descartes Cogito argument involves the need to doubt absolutely everything (because of the malicious demon argument) at first before you are sure of your existence. Lenny does not seem to doubt everything. While he does rely on the polaroids to remember certain people like Teddy, Dodd, and Natalie, he does not seem to doubt other interactions he has. For example, his interactions with Burt, the front desk man, the waiter at the City Grill, Natalie when she gives him the tankard with various spit, the tattoo lady, etc. At no point does he think that any of these people could be deceiving him and he even relies on them many times.</p>
<p>Locke&rsquo;s Theory of Personal Identity requires that the person be aware of their continuing existence. Lenny isn&rsquo;t able to form new memories, and thus, is only aware of moments of his existence before the accident. Even Teddy tells him that he doesn&rsquo;t even know how many years have passed since the accident. In other words, it isn&rsquo;t a continuous stream of consciousness.</p>
<p>Hume&rsquo;s Theory, on the other hand, says that we can not convince the thought of something unless we have experienced it before. And that all those experiences link together to form a train of thought. In addition, we will have different perceptions at different times, that we have multiple perceptions. This seems applicable to Lenny&rsquo;s situation. Each colored scene serves as different perceptions. This is most prominent in the scene where Natalie says horrible things to Lenny and his past life only for him to forget it moments later. His perception of her is different than the one before because now she&rsquo;s someone that got beaten up. In other moments, Teddy can serve as a friend or someone who he doesn&rsquo;t know. Teddy goes with him as a friend when they go to a diner and but before, he was a stranger in Lenny&rsquo;s (or rather Jimmy&rsquo;s) car. In addition, all his notes on the polaroids and notes on the murder case serve as his experiences, those linking together to form the mystery of who murdered his wife for him. In other words, the notes he has on the case, the map, the polaroids, all physically represent that train of thought which Lenny relies on. Thus, Hume&rsquo;s theory of personal identity best fits Lenny.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s still one question I have after watching this film&ndash; how is Lenny able to remember that he has a condition that makes him unable to form new memories? He is told that he has issues with forming them seem to happen after the accident. Is there a tattoo that tells him that he has what Sam had?</p>
