  I Discern, Therefore I Disguise: Case Six Analysis
  <a class="anchor" href="#i-discern-therefore-i-disguise-case-six-analysis">#</a>
</h1>
<p>Reading through the many cases for this assignment, I felt most drawn to Case Six: “Respect for Patients, Physicians, and the Truth” by Susan Cullen and Margaret Klein. Throughout this paper, I will summarize the case, review the doctor’s options, the considerations for each of these options, and my opinion on which option the doctor should choose and deliver to the patient.</p>
<p>Case Six introduces us to Susan Cruz, a thirty-four-year-old single mother with a six-year-old boy, suffering from agonizing headaches that lead to vomiting and dizziness. In one episode, she loses control of the left side of her body and is seen by Dr. Charles Lambert, a neurologist. After an MRI scan, she suffered two seizures, leading to an immediate brain biopsy by neurosurgeon Dr. Clare Williams. The two review the results of these tests which reveal Susan has a very aggressive brain cancer, extremely advanced in its stage. Dr. Williams informed Dr. Lambert that any kind of surgical procedure would not be worth any risk of damaging the brain further and radiation treatments would have little effect on extending Susan’s life. Additionally, in Susan’s case, she would only have a few weeks to live. With this information, Dr. Lambert then reports to Susan the reasons for her symptoms, forgoing any mention of brain cancer and information on her prognosis. He offers radiation therapy and other medications to alleviate her symptoms. He does not disclose any explanations for why surgery would be unnecessary and his estimation of the time she has left. Hopeful, Susan remarks she must get well so that she can take care of her young son. She follows the treatment plan, takes the drugs prescribed to her, and shows up for weekly radiation appointments. However, by the fifth week, she is admitted to the hospital due to uncontrollable seizures and dies after a day of admission.</p>
<p>Given Susan&rsquo;s late-stage cancer, Dr. Lambert has two options: 1) not telling Susan her diagnosis or prognosis, or 2) informing Susan about her diagnosis and prognosis, of which, he delivers the former.</p>
<p>In the first option, Dr. Lambert does not disclose to Susan her diagnosis or prognosis. This option aligns closely with the paternalistic model of the doctor-patient relationship, specifically the point, that Professor Buss describes in class, that doctors are not obligated to share any information when they judge that doing so would result in harm to their patients. In choosing this option, Dr. Lambert spares Susan the distress and anxiety that usually come with a devastating diagnosis, instead giving her hope that her disease is manageable with radiation treatment and drugs to alleviate her symptoms. In doing so, this also allows Susan to live a relatively normal life with the time she has left. The drugs will improve the quality of her life as they will reduce headaches and seizures, while the radiation treatments allow her to feel that her disease is being treated and that she is being cared for. Understanding that she has little time left and a severe disease, Dr. Lambert takes on the burden of decision-making to refrain from causing Susan any additional harm.</p>
<p>In the second option, Dr. Lambert discloses to Susan her diagnosis and prognosis. As described by Professor Buss in lecture, the following must be required for doctors to do for a patient’s choice to be “informed”: share the diagnosis, explain what treatments they favor and why, mention other alternatives, explain the costs and benefits, and explain the likelihood of the effects of these treatments. If Dr. Lambert discloses the following information, Susan would be aware of the state of her disease as well as the time she has remaining. She would understand why complex treatments may not work and what other treatments could be used to reduce the symptoms she has. While it is difficult to say what the effects of this option will be, it is certain that this option pushes the burden of decision-making onto Susan instead. She may take on Dr. Lambert’s suggestions, opt for alternative methods, or refuse medical treatment altogether. In addition, this option prepares Susan for her life down the line and the future ahead. Overall, this option gives the patient, Susan, control over her medical treatments and life plans.</p>
<p>While both options have their arguments, I believe the second option is more compelling. What the first option fails to consider is Susan’s desires. If anything, I believe that Dr. Lambert has failed to honor Susan’s desires.</p>
<p>It is clear to us that one of Susan’s global desires is to take care of her son Bryan. We learn from the case that she is the primary caregiver of her son (a single mother). When Dr. Lambert chooses the first option, he may be satisfying Susan’s local desire to take care of Bryan right after her hospital visit.  In the Success Theory described by Parfit, desires hold true even after death. This option prevents Susan from planning her son’s future care as well as any arrangements (such as financial ones). If, for example, Susan’s mother were to also pass away shortly after, Bryan’s care would be a decision made by the state, rather than it being Susan’s decision. Furthermore, it wouldn’t allow Susan to emotionally prepare her son for her fate. Unlike the second option, the first does not take Susan’s desire to care for Bryan into consideration after her death, resulting in an unfulfilled desire.</p>
<p>Another of Susan’s desires is to not burden her mother with extra responsibilities. Susan knows her mother suffers from a heart problem and understands that her young son can be a handful to take care of. Susan’s symptoms of seizures and headaches would only be additional concerns for her mother, as it seems her mother would greatly be concerned for her daughter’s health. If Susan were informed of her diagnosis, prognosis, and possible treatments, she may choose a different treatment than the one described in the case. Perhaps she may consider financial concerns; after all, admission to a hospital, MRI scans, and a biopsy are already expensive enough. If radiation treatment happens to be even more expensive and she recognizes she has such very limited time to live, she may refuse it to not burden her mother with additional medical debt. Considering her son, on the other hand, would allow Susan to plan how to take care of Bryan, rather than this responsibility being thrust upon her mother upon Susan’s sudden death. By choosing the first option, Dr. Lambert has dishonored Susan’s desire by taking those opportunities for her to plan away; sudden responsibilities are now pushed onto her mother.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Susan Cruz’s case is an extremely tragic one. For a single mother with very little time to live, Dr. Lambert dishonored her desires and disguised her diagnosis and prognosis with what he believed would cause less harm. In my opinion, this would only cause more harm, from leaving Bryan’s care up to uncertainty and burdening Susan’s mother with additional responsibilities. Rather than disguising and withholding Susan’s diagnosis and prognosis, Dr. Lambert should take some time to better understand Susan’s desires and include her in the decision-making process.</p>
