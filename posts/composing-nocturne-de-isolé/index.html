</h1>
<p>While reading Frankenstein, I couldn’t help but notice the many applications of Plato’s philosophy throughout the text. I had just previously read and analyzed many pages of The Republic and wanted to apply to anything that seemed to fit. One day, it was the Allegory of the Cave, with darkness represented Victor Frankenstein’s ignorance and light symbolizing the blinding truth that would follow. But what intrigued me the most was the theme of isolation and alienation in both Victor and the creature. We had previously studied Platonistic harmony in one’s soul and learned that an imbalance of the parts of the soul could lead to bad actions and disharmony. All these together lead to the question: does isolation lead to the destruction of the soul?</p>
<p>We needed to first understand Plato’s tripartite theory of the soul. He believed that the soul had three parts to it: appetites, our innate desires for pleasure and comfort such as bodily ease; spirit, our angered response to injustice that is being done; and reason, our rational thinking that oversees the other two parts and decides which side is better to lean on.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the book, Victor isolates himself from the world to create the creature. Once he has created the creature, he forces himself into more isolation as he can not tell anyone about his creation which leads him to become sicker and sicker, both mentally and physically. Victor ignores his appetites as he is confined to his secret of the creation of his creature. The lack of a functioning appetites makes his soul disharmonious, sicking, and eventually destroying his soul until his friend Henry seeks to help him.</p>
<p>Unlike Victor, later in the book, the creature leans to his appetites and places it in charge while disregarding rational thinking. And because rational thinking is no longer in control of what actions to pursue, the creature does what he wants based on his comforts. While he does later show some use of his rational thinking, the creature is still mostly dependent on what he feels is most comfortable for him. This meaning a disregard of the humans around him when he kills William. This imbalance of his soul leads to the creature’s hatred of the world and himself. His isolation to stay away from humans due to the previous bad experiences only furthers this imbalance as he is pursuing what would be most comfortable for him (in this case, not being attacked by pitchforks).</p>
<p>In the end, both of the nearly destroyed souls come together for the final blow with Victor driving himself to death chasing the creature and the creature declaring his intention to kill himself. The isolation the characters have pursued only accelerated the destruction of the souls.</p>
<p>To replicate this in music, I first needed to establish a few things: what genre I would be writing in, the composition style, the form, and the small melodies that would soon be repeating leitmotifs.</p>
<p>The genre was easy. I wanted to reflect on the Romantic-era style of playing and settled on a few composers I had analyzed over the years: Schubert, Wagner, and Chopin. Their distinctive style of music often reflected nature, were inspired by poems, or told a tale. Besides, Frankenstein is a Romantic-era book, it would only be fitting to write with Romantic ear style.</p>
<p>I determined the composition style next. When I was developing my prospectus, I decided to write a nocturne rather than an overture. While an overture would certainly represent the entire scene, such as Tchaikovsky’s Romeo and Juliet or Hamlet Overture, they lacked the emotion and feeling of the individuals. It better represented the general feeling of the scene (eg. In Romeo and Juliet, a minor key and quick agitated sixteenth notes with a clash between the string and woodwinds represented the warring Capulets and Montagues). A nocturne, on the other hand, would allow me to explore the themes of isolation while in the night, much like Chopin’s many nocturnes. The soprano/melody line would represent the themes of isolation experienced by both characters while the bass line would be arpeggiated chords, reflecting the environment surrounding the characters.</p>
<p>The ABA+Coda form was chosen. I would represent Victor’s and the creature’s initial isolation in the first A section. This section was written in minor, reflecting the dark nature of being isolated and alienated as their souls deteriorated. The B section would then represent their conversation of isolation with nature surrounding them as in this scene, they were both not isolated as they had each other. There would be a key change to major, representing the light conversation with naturing surrounding all around them but sprinkled with dissonance chords for those themes of isolation. The final section, A+Coda, would be the final blow to their souls as they both are filled with self-hatred and feelings of isolation. The cadenza nearing the last measure would be the final blow, ending it all. As the piece ends, it fades into a major key once again: the end of the isolation ages for both of the characters.</p>
<p>And finally, establishing the leitmotifs I would use for the piece. The main motif I had been playing around with in my head was the Dies Irae. The Dies Irae was a medieval chant that is most related to death. Inspired by the musical Sweeney Todd, composed by Stephen Sondheim, I twisted and turn the theme every way (upside down, backward, altercated with rhythm) to represent different themes, also known as leitmotifs. Richard Wagner is most infamous for his use of leitmotifs in his magnum opus Der Ring des Nibelungen. By using the first few measures of the Dies Irae and the playful nature of leitmotifs, it made the most sense to use this to represent the creature since wherever the creature goes, wherever death follows. At the same time, he was made by Victor, or “birth” to consciousness by him (the Dies Irae would now be used upside down). Ornamentations in the piece would represent the sickly and leeches of isolation to the soul.</p>
<p>With all these components, I started composing on manuscript paper before transferring that online. I made sure to feature as many parts as I could to the piece itself. Some areas would softer than others, representing a silent room in isolation. Others would show the anger and hatred towards the world that want to be expressed out loud rather than ahead. After a couple of hours, I finally finished. It was complete.</p>
