  <div class="single-content">
    <p>There’s this wide space that takes up a great amount of room on the bookshelf in my room - it’s my small collection of anthologies! I recall buying these a few years ago, at a small bookstore. It’s been a habit of mine to pull them out every once in a while to read something I like or to look for “that one poem I want to quote at that one time”. So when a good friend of mine needed some help on her IB English poem analysis assignment, I was quite eager to start. She gave me Pablo Neruda’s “Tonight I write the saddest lines” to look at and so below is my small analysis of the poem. The poem is linked <a href="https://www.poemhunter.com/poem/tonight-i-can-write-the-saddest-lines/">here</a>.</p>
<p>This poem has a lot to unpack. The first read-through, the reader may feel their heart-string being pulled by the poem’s melancholy tone but there is so much more than just that.</p>
<p>First starters, the first line, “Tonight I can write the saddest lines” already sets the tone of the poem. The phrase “Tonight I can write” is the speaker indirectly telling us that he isn’t able to write this until this time of the day. Perhaps the speaker is feeling such raw emotions that are too difficult to place into actual coherent words.</p>
<p>The two lines following that explain the speaker’s current feelings on the subject on the matter- his relationship with a girl as we learn later. The lines “The night is shattered and the blue stars shiver in the distance” is a metaphor for this relationship. The night is the love that has been shattered as we see this lines later in “The night is shattered and she is not with me.” The stars are blue because not only is blue a harder color to see in black, but they also represent the emotion of sadness. Like day where there is warmth, the speaker says it is night as it’s cold- the relationship has a tinge of coldness between the former two lovers. This is cold enough to make the stars shiver. These lines also use imagery as the reader is able to see how the speaker sees the cold night.</p>
<p>The speaker further gives us more imagery a few lines down when he talks about kissing the girl under the endless sky. This imagery gives a setting of how things used to be between the two lovers. The “endless skies” could be a metaphor of how the speaker felt about the relationship back then- endless. The line “I kissed her again and again” just before the “endless skies” uses repetition of the word “again” to let us know that them sharing kisses again and again is like a loop- almost endless.</p>
<p>The speaker lets us know that “to hear the immense night, still more immense without her” makes him feel that as if the night wasn’t even more lonely and cold, but it’s so very vastly empty without her. That now because she’s gone, this emptiness wallows into the night.</p>
<p>The repetition of the speaker saying that “Tonight I can write the saddest lines” reminds us and emphasizes on him feeling so melancholic. It’s deep in the night and he’s writing these lines to tell the story of his emotions.</p>
<p>When the speaker hears someone singing in the distance, he is pulled back into reality again and realizes that there is a person “in the distance” that is singing by repeating the phrase. Later in the poem, in the lines “My soul is not satisfied that is has lost her. My sight searches for her as though to go to her. My heart looks for her, and she is not with me”, the speaker tells us that his soul, sight, and heart all try looking for her but she’s nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>The repetition of “the same” in the line “The same night whitening the same trees. We, of that time, are no longer the same.” is the speaker telling us that while everything around him is the same, the tress and night, they are no longer the same as they are no longer lovers.</p>
<p>The speaker then goes on to say that he “no longer loves her, that’s for certain” but lines later say that “but maybe I love her” to indicate that he still can not let go. He’s trying to forget it all but it’s a raging war within him- the side to remember or let go and forget. Memories of them together and the thought of her with someone else plagues his mind as he is trying to move on. He is envy that the kisses he used to steal from her now belong to another and they are “like kisses” but no longer his to steal back from her. The line is almost bitter.</p>
<p>In the last two lines, the speaker tells us that he will no longer suffer because of her. These are the last lines that will feel such anguish and pain for her because he’s moved on. It’s somewhat bitter and still melancholic but the speaker wants to move on.</p>
