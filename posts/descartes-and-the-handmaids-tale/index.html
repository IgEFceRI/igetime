    <p><em>Note: This very much become a rambling on Descartes and how it relates to Handmaid’s Tale. Hopefully it’s not too rambly, I’m just jotting my ideas down.</em></p>

  Main Reflection

</h1>
<p>I’ve been thinking a lot about dissociation, especially since I’ve just finished my Introduction to Philosophy dual enrollment class. Sure, I haven’t obtained or reached the ultimate “profoundness” and “enlightenment” yet, despite its scientific inaccuracies and logical holes, Descartes’s theory on the Dream and Mind-Body Dualism (from his <em>Meditations</em>) has plagued my mind for quite some time.</p>
<p>Just as a small side note on these ideas:</p>
<ol>
<li>In his Cognito argument, Descartes established a thinking self to exist. The basis of the argument goes like this: there is an evil deceiver who could be creating a reality for me, making me believe certain things I sense and perceive to be true. So, therefore, I must doubt everything I sense and perceive. But I am aware that my doubting self is thinking, so therefore, I exist (or simplified it’s the famous “I think, therefore I am”). Thus, I know that my thinking self exists.</li>
<li>To know that my body exists, however, I must rely on my senses. Descartes believed that we only know our body based on the empirical observation from our senses which can be manipulated by the evil deceiver. The body only senses/observes what it is given to perceive.</li>
<li>In this sense, the thinking self and the body are different things (distinct) that are separate. The thinking self basis it’s existence on logic while the body does with observations. Descartes is “certain that I am really distinct from my body, and can exist without it.”</li>
</ol>
<p>If we’re reading <em>Handmaid’s Tale</em> through this idea, we see the dissociation between the mind and body happen a lot. In fact, it’s painfully obvious but indirect. The mind is something that is able to freely think, held in a vessel that is the body which is limited to its boundaries and rigid edges. With this in mind, we see that Offred uses this as an escape. Although her body is trapped within the Gilead and the position and tasks of a handmaid, her mind is thinkings freely. In a particular scene, one that has made the most impact on me, Offred wheres her red dress, noting to the reader that she thinks she doesn’t look good in red. By doing so, and thinking so, she is able to maintain her opinions, her ideas, and think freely but silently about what she believes. This exemplifies how she is able to maintain her character&ndash; with all these “quirky” thoughts and opinions. A little later in the book, during the ceremony, Offred barely thinks about what is happening and more focused on the Senera’s thoughts and almost everything but what is currently happening. Her mind is a part separate from the body, thinking about something else rather than what her body is going through. In this case, she is still able to maintain her character by ignoring what her body experiences and follow her mind and train of thought.</p>
<p>Taking a different look from Descarte’s ideas, after the ceremony, Offred narrates this: “Can I be blamed for wanting a real body, to put my arms around? Without it I too am disembodied.” This line has more to do with the idea of her role in these societies: the old and the new. She was formally a mother, a wife but those titles and roles, even the responsibilities that come with them are completely gone.</p>
<p>Just as a last quick note, I’ve noticed in Chapter 14 that instead of Descarte’s famous line “I think, therefore I am,” the phrase has changed to “I tell, therefore you are.” This just shows the differences between the two societies and how this new one is much more in control, much more oppressive to the point where there isn’t this idea of individuality.</p>

</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve mentioned before on dissociation and how that relates to Descarte&rsquo;s Cognito argument and Theory on Mind-Body Dualism. The line in Chapter 14 particularly stood out to me since it had the line &ldquo;I tell, therefore you are,&rdquo; an obvious poke on Descarte&rsquo;s famous line &ldquo;I think, therefore I am&rdquo; or also known as the conclusion fo the Cognito argument. While it&rsquo;s an obvious pun or jab at the line, I couldn&rsquo;t help but notice a lot of Descarte&rsquo;s two ideas throughout the reading. For example, dissociation, which I wrote about before. This idea that while the body is experiencing these horrible things, senses perceiving these ideas through posters, the hangings, the pictures, the shouts, the phrases they are told to repeat, the mind is still free to think about whatever and to believe in whatever. Essentially saying that the mind and body are two very distinct things that while are connected, can operate separately.</p>
<p>However, I couldn&rsquo;t help but think that the book comes from this idea that the society beforehand allowed this free-thinking, allowed this idea of individuality and independent thought and opinion. But when it comes to the Gilead takeover, the new structures, ideas, beliefs, have all essentially gotten rid of them, somewhat like a good brainwashing. Furthermore, reading and writing are banned, forcing this new generation that is growing up around this change to believe in everything Gilead wants them to believe in. Whoever you are, you are what Gilead tells you to be, thus the whole &ldquo;I tell, therefore you are.&rdquo; Of course, how about those who lived before Gilead like Offred herself? Must they dissociate to maintain who they are? And how does one give in to believing these new ideas? Sure, when it comes to life or death, you can agree publically and disagree silently but how does one remember to keep that and not give into believing these new ideas?</p>
<p>I think for many of those who happen to agree with all these new changes practice less dissociation, or none at all. I suppose in a way, you can consider that their body and mind are fused together rather than the mind being the flower in a flower pot that is the body. Instead of having separate ideas that may disagree with the body and what it&rsquo;s perceived, they agree completely. This, in turn, deteriorates their individuality, their own ideas and thoughts, and molds those ideas into what the system wants you to believe, what the society wants you to think (whether that be through posters, imagery, shouts, phrases). It very much so reflects the idea of what we experience now with social media, influencers, and all that jazz. It&rsquo;s these developed biases that you can use to manipulate in a way.</p>
