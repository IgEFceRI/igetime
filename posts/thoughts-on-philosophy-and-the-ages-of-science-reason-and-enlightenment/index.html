  Metaphysical (and somewhat Rational) and Empirical Approaches to self
  <a class="anchor" href="#metaphysical-and-somewhat-rational-and-empirical-approaches-to-self">#</a>
</h1>
<h2 class="heading" id="descartes-vs-locke--humes">
  Descartes vs Locke &amp; Humes
  <a class="anchor" href="#descartes-vs-locke--humes">#</a>
</h2>
<p>What I find most interesting is that the metaphysical approach deals with logic while the empirical approach involves observations and experience (so far as to say it depends on those two). Descartes uses the metaphysical approach to explain self. The best example of this is through his work Meditations, in particular, the three arguments that are explained in the work. He explains that it is possible I am dreaming so I can not fully believe the knowledge I obtain from the environment around me (in other words, I can&rsquo;t trust experiences I have). This is ultimately the Cognito argument (I think, therefore I am). He determines that we know of our existence because of our thinking-selves.</p>
<p>Besides his arguments in Meditations, Descartes also believed in mind-body dualism, the idea that our minds are not something physical, something that exists outside of the body. It is through our mind and logic that we can determine who we are in terms of existence and identity. Both of these arguments are metaphysical, using logic to determine one’s self rather than depending on the observations and experiences we’ve obtained from our environment.</p>
<p>Locke, on the other hand, takes the experiences and observations we collect from our environment and world and turns that into knowledge. That what we have learned through life has come from our conscious self who has experienced moments. For Locke, it is the experiences and observations made by the consciousness that defines self and identity. Locke’s arguments for self and self-identity are thus, empirical. The basis of his ideas for self depends on the observations and experiences our thinking/experiencing self has experienced and that is ultimately our self-identity.</p>
<p>Humes! He believed that there is in no way a self that exists throughout a certain lifetime because we are constantly different in each passing second, even if by a little. That we are not an existing identity because of our consciousness, just a rapid collection of experiences. As we live, according to Hume&rsquo;s theory, we are always changing in each moment. Contradicting Descarte&rsquo;s thoughts about the thinking self, Humes says &ldquo;Our thought is still more variable than our sight&rdquo;, implying sight as a sense (Descartes tells us that we can not rely on our senses).</p>
<p>I find this really interesting since Descartes also did a lot of scientific work (law of refraction, work on analytic geometry, and the invention of the Cartesian coordinates), which comes from observations (empirical). His philosophy on self is more leaning towards rationalism rather than empiricism. And while I know the two can both co-exist, it just seems funny to me that he doubts the things he observes and experiences in life, rather than taking Locke&rsquo;s or Hume&rsquo;s approach.</p>
<p>To conclude this massive section, I think the most interesting is seeing how the 17-18th century philosophers determined what the self is. Should we rely on our observations and senses? Or should we scrap those and be in favor of our minds and our rational thought? It&rsquo;s a struggle between observing and rational thinking (and yet science uses both&hellip;).</p>
<h2 class="heading" id="kant-self-and-ethics">
  Kant (self and ethics)
  <a class="anchor" href="#kant-self-and-ethics">#</a>
</h2>
<p>This is rather going to be more of a mention than anything since we just started on some of his ethics and thinking of self. He believed that certain actions were prohibited and that we must ask ourselves two questions before we decide to act: 1. Can I rationally will that everyone act as I propose to act? If the answer is no, then we must not perform the action. And 2. Does my action respect the goals of human beings rather than merely using them for my own purposes? If the answer is no, then we must not perform the action. I have a packet to analyze today so maybe I&rsquo;ll find something about enlightenment??? Maybe, he seems pretty cool.</p>
<h2 class="heading" id="plato-stuff-and-descartes">
  Plato Stuff and Descartes
  <a class="anchor" href="#plato-stuff-and-descartes">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Not exactly 17th -18th century at all but some ideas about Plato. I&rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about his Allegory of the Cave. In it, he talks about these prisoners being tied to face one side of a cave and watching the shadows on the wall cast by puppet showmen. In other words, the cave is an allegory for the visible world, whereas the outside world (for those who have escaped the cave) is the intelligible world. Plato says we know the world through our senses and that&rsquo;s a problem. Our senses (5 here) limited our interactions to only the shadow world and give us a poor copy of what the world really/truly is. He believed that to discover reality, we must use our intellect, this being logic, abstract thought, theoretical knowledge, scientific reasoning, mathematics, etc. This all reminds me deeply of Descartes&rsquo;s meditations, somewhat leading me to think that perhaps he was inspired on some part by Plato? It seems reasonable since he was in the midst of the latter part of the Renaissance and it&rsquo;s the whole Greek Revival thing.</p>
