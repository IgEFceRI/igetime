      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, it all started as a small math project- to research any topic we wanted and relate it to calculus. Of course, as soon as I heard the words &amp;ldquo;any topic&amp;rdquo;, I was off, thinking all sorts of ideas that I could do: music theory (specifically why some chords sound better than others), the golden ratio, origami? At this point, I was just trying to relate any hobby of mine to calculus. We still had a couple of months left so I decided to leave the project alone for a while and focus on other things.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
